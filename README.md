# butterfly_classifier
A project to showcase the progress in learning about DeepLearning.

# Description
This project (which might get updated regularly) showcases the progress of my learning on DeepLearning. This project helps in classifying the kinds of butterflies, the app is presented as a [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) web app that takes in the user-provided image and classifies it to their respective kind with the prediction percentage. 

The DeepLearning model has been trained on the following varieties of butterflies:
1. Monarch
2. Painted Lady
3. Red Admiral
4. Viceroy
5. Bronze Copper
6. Buckeye

The model showcases an `error_rate` of ~6.7%.

# Results
